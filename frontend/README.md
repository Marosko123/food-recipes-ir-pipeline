## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Backend API server running on port 8000

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev

```

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the Python Flask backend through these endpoints:

- `POST /api/search` - Search recipes with filters
- `GET /api/recipes/{id}` - Get detailed recipe information
- `GET /api/cuisines` - Get list of available cuisines
- `GET /api/ingredients` - Get list of ingredients
- `GET /api/stats` - Get search engine statistics
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
